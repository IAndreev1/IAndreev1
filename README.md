ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Andreev, @IAndreev1, a recent graduate in Software Engineering from TU Wien!

ðŸŒ± I am deeply passionate about object-oriented programming, particularly in Java. You can explore my Spring projects on GitHub [Easy Flat](https://github.com/IAndreev1/sellit) or [Sell It](https://github.com/IAndreev1/EasyFlat).

ðŸ¤– My interests extend beyond web development to include artificial intelligence (AI) and data analysis. For my bachelor's thesis, I focused on controversy measurement in discussions on [Der Standard](https://www.derstandard.at) employing graph theory and leveraging various Python libraries for data analysis. I also utilized language models such as BERT and Gemini for my research.

ðŸŽ“ Additionally, I'm excited to share that I'll be continuing my academic journey at FMI Sofia by pursuing a master's degree in Software Engineering.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via email at ivan.andreev.dev@gmail.com , or connect with me on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-andreev-738118253.
